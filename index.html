      <p>
        My little princess has grown up so much!<br />
        I hope you’re doing well, and I pray everything is fine at home.<br />
        I know you must be missing me, but listen—<br />
        whenever you think of me, just look at your elder brother;<br />
        he’s just like my reflection.<br />
        If you ever need anything, just tell him,<br />
        and he’ll make sure you get it.<br /><br />
        Never consider yourself alone,<br />
        you are papa’s strong girl after all.<br />
        Everything will be alright, just stay strong.<br /><br />
        Enjoy your special day,<br />
        spread kindness, do some charity,<br />
        and don’t forget to keep me in your prayers.<br />
        Alhamdulillah, I am doing well. ❤️

    <p>Happy Birthday, my little star,<br>
    Look how grown and graceful you are.<br>
    Though miles apart, my love will stay,<br>
    Guiding you softly, come what may.</p>

    <p>When you miss me, just look and see,<br>
    Your brother’s smile—it’s a part of me.<br>
    For every wish, for every dream,<br>
    He’ll bring you joy like a shining beam.</p>

    <p>You’re papa’s strong girl, brave and true,<br>
    No storm can break the light in you.<br>
    Celebrate, smile, spread kindness today,<br>
    And in your prayers, send love my way.</p>
